# Demonstrating Software Quality - Survey

## Introduction
This project provides a  list of guidelines for the best practices to refer to during the development of a standard industry Software Project. 

Before starting to code any standard software development project there are numerous components that need to be considered first. 
These componets include the following: 
- **Scrum Sprint Backlog and Task Estimation**

- **Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development**

- **Test Coverage Metric**

- **Team Version-Control**

- **Code-Review Checklist**

In this project I am required to create a software component for storing information about Surveys and Responses. However, this component does not require a user interface or external storage. The main objective of this assignment is to highlight the best practices to follow with a focus on writing unit tests to identify if the code is correct while also following a GitFlow process.
